## ⚠️ Safety Protocols & Lessons Learned

### Critical Safety Measures
1. **Always Test on Single Database First**: Never run mass operations without testing
2. **Manual Verification Required**: Verify automation logic before large-scale execution
3. **Backup Verification**: Ensure backup systems are functional before major changes
4. **Incremental Approach**: Process databases in small batches with verification steps

### Automation Guidelines
1. **UUID Validation**: Always validate database IDs before operations
2. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for API operations
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits with appropriate delays
4. **Rollback Capability**: Ensure all operations can be reversed if needed

### Documentation Standards
1. **Vertical Formatting**: All lists must be displayed vertically for readability
2. **Complete Field Analysis**: Document all field types, options, and relationships
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep documentation synchronized with database changes
4. **Version Control**: Track all changes through git commits
